# List of notable changes made between 2.x and 3.0

All breaking changes must be described here. When adding a new entry,
always describe the impact on users and instructions for upgrading
applications from 2.x to 3.0.

## Invocation for remote method has been changed.

We are deprecating the `SharedClass.prototype.find` and
`SharedClass.prototype.disableMethod` for looking up and disabling remote
methods in 3.0. They will be replaced by `SharedClass.prototype.findMethodByName`
and `SharedClass.prototype.disableMethodByName` where you can pass in a static
method or a prototype method name. These new methods will accept a string in the
form of "name" for a static method and "prototype.name" for a prototype method.

To find a static remote method:
`findMethodByName('create')`

To find a prototype remote method:
`findMethodByName('prototype.updateAttributes')`

To disable a static remote method
`disableMethodByName('create')`

To disable a prototype remote method:
`disableMethodByName('prototype.updateAttributes')`

## New error-handler for rest-adapter

The REST adapter (typically created via `loopback.rest()`) uses a new error
handler implementation that provides more secure configuration out of the box.

The `error.status` has been removed and will be replaced by `error.statusCode`,
`statusCode` is more descriptive and avoids ambiguity, users relying on `status`
will need to change implementation accordingly.

To replicate old behavior user can specify `config.local.js` as follow:
```js
module.exports = {
  remoting : {
    errorHandler: {
      handler : function(err, req, res, defaultHandler) {
        err.status = err.statusCode;
        defaultHandler();
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The environment setting `NODE_ENV='production'` is no longer supported,
production vs. debug mode is controlled exclusively by configuration.
Production environment is assumed by default, the insecure debug mode
must be explicitely turned on.

You can learn more about the rationale behind the new handler in
[this comment](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback/issues/1650#issuecomment-161920555)

User can specific options in their applications in `config.json` as follow:
```json
{
  "restApiRoot": "/api",
  "host": "0.0.0.0",
  "port": 3000,
  "remoting": {
    "errorHandler": {
      "debug": false,
      "log": false
    }
  }
}
```

#### Production mode

Stack trace is never returned in HTTP responses.

Bad Request errors (4xx) provide the following properties copied from the
error object: `name`, `message`, `statusCode` and `details`.

All other errors (including non-Error values like strings or arrays) provide
only basic information: `statusCode` and `message` set to status name from HTTP
specification.

#### Debug mode

When in debug mode, HTTP responses include all properties provided by the error.

For errors that are not an object, their string value is returned in
`message` field.

When a method fails with an array of errors (e.g. bulk create), HTTP the response
contains still a single wrapper error with `details` set to the original array
of errors.

An example of an error response when an array of errors was raised:

```js
{
  error: {
    statusCode: 500,
    name: 'ArrayOfErrors',
    message: 'Failed with multiple errors, see `details` for more information.',
    details: [
      { name: 'Error1', message: 'expected error', statusCode: 500, stack: '<stacktrace>' },
      { name: 'Error2', message: 'expected error2', statusCode: 500, stack: '<stacktrace>'}
    ]
  }
}
```
